## Synopsis

Home made project to practice my C++ skills. Also I would like to create some usefull libraries for my later projects.

## Motivation

Just for practice.

## Installation

Unfortunetly currently I'm working with Eclipse on windows and I don't have a makefile for it. So if you create an empty eclipse project whatever toolchain you will able to build the project.
